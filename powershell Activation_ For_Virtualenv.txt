How do I enable script running in PowerShell?
1. Open Run Command/Console ( Win + R )
2. Type: gpedit.msc (Group Policy Editor)
3. Browse to Local Computer Policy -> Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> Windows Powershell.
4. Enable "Turn on Script Execution"
5. Set the policy as needed. I set mine to "Allow all scripts".
